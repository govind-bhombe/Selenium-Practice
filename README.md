#Selenium Interview Questions 

1. Can we open a browser without creating a WebDriver object in Selenium?

‚úîÔ∏èNo. WebDriver object is mandatory to launch a browser instance.

2. What is the use of driver.close() vs driver.quit()?

‚úîÔ∏èdriver.close() closes the current tab; driver.quit() shuts all browser windows and ends the session.

3. Can we handle authentication popups in Selenium?

‚úîÔ∏èYes

4. What if an element is not interactable even though it is visible?

‚úîÔ∏èIt might be overlapped or not ready. Use explicit wait or scroll into view.

5. What is fluent wait in Selenium?

‚úîÔ∏èA wait that checks for a condition at regular intervals until timeout. More flexible than WebDriverWait.

6. Can we simulate keyboard keys in Selenium?

‚úîÔ∏èYes, using Actions class or sendKeys(Keys.ENTER).

7. How do you upload a file in Selenium?

‚úîÔ∏èUse sendKeys() to input the path to the file input element.

8. Why is Thread.sleep() not recommended?

‚úîÔ∏èBecause it's static and can cause unnecessary delays. Use explicit waits instead.

9. Can we take a full-page screenshot in Selenium?

‚úîÔ∏èOnly in Firefox by default. For Chrome, use third-party tools or JavaScript scroll capture.

10. What is implicit wait?

‚úîÔ∏èA global wait applied for the life of WebDriver instance to wait for element presence.

11. What is Selenium Grid and when should you use it?

‚úîÔ∏èSelenium Grid allows running tests on multiple machines/browsers in parallel, helping reduce execution time and enabling cross-browser testing.

12. How is Selenium 4 different from Selenium 3?

‚úîÔ∏èSelenium 4 introduced W3C WebDriver protocol, better browser support, relative locators, and built-in DevTools API for performance and network monitoring.
