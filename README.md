#Selenium Interview Questions 

1. Can we open a browser without creating a WebDriver object in Selenium?

✔️No. WebDriver object is mandatory to launch a browser instance.

2. What is the use of driver.close() vs driver.quit()?

✔️driver.close() closes the current tab; driver.quit() shuts all browser windows and ends the session.

3. Can we handle authentication popups in Selenium?

✔️Yes

4. What if an element is not interactable even though it is visible?

✔️It might be overlapped or not ready. Use explicit wait or scroll into view.

5. What is fluent wait in Selenium?

✔️A wait that checks for a condition at regular intervals until timeout. More flexible than WebDriverWait.

6. Can we simulate keyboard keys in Selenium?

✔️Yes, using Actions class or sendKeys(Keys.ENTER).

7. How do you upload a file in Selenium?

✔️Use sendKeys() to input the path to the file input element.

8. Why is Thread.sleep() not recommended?

✔️Because it's static and can cause unnecessary delays. Use explicit waits instead.

9. Can we take a full-page screenshot in Selenium?

✔️Only in Firefox by default. For Chrome, use third-party tools or JavaScript scroll capture.

10. What is implicit wait?

✔️A global wait applied for the life of WebDriver instance to wait for element presence.

11. What is Selenium Grid and when should you use it?

✔️Selenium Grid allows running tests on multiple machines/browsers in parallel, helping reduce execution time and enabling cross-browser testing.

12. How is Selenium 4 different from Selenium 3?

✔️Selenium 4 introduced W3C WebDriver protocol, better browser support, relative locators, and built-in DevTools API for performance and network monitoring.
