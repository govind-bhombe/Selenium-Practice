✅ Coding Questions
1. Could you provide a program that identifies and prints duplicate numbers from a given array?
9. Write a Java program to find duplicate elements in an array.
10. Write a method to check if a string is a palindrome.
11. Given an array of integers, return the first non-repeating element. If none, return -1.
1. Can you introduce yourself and share a bit about your background?
2. Given the input lists `𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁 = [𝟱, 𝟰, 𝟲, 𝟮, 𝟯]`, `𝗳𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 = [𝟴, 𝟱, 𝟰, 𝟯, 𝟱]`, and a budget of 10, what is the maximum profit you can achieve? For example, you can buy stocks at indices 0, 3, and 4 for a total of 5 + 2 + 3 = 10 and sell them the next year for 8 + 3 + 5 = 16, resulting in a profit of 6.
